# "Back to the 90's..." project

A long time ago I developed interfaces for a company that no longer exists, but the memories remain.

It was the dark age of square windows in Windows 95. Everything about the user interface was flat, square, and boring. I was lucky enough to convince the management to add a little fun, and it was the right decision at the time. I still love this design.
